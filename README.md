# basic-NFT-generator
This just exists to point out how easy it is to generate NFT series. This one can generate random images from given layers. In the example folders inside the NFTparts folder you find 6 backgrounds, 6 bodies, 5 body clothing, 4 eyes, 2 mouths (I refused to torture myself with that) and 6 hats. That is 8640 combinations. I spent about 15 minutes with them. You can call it Crappy Ape Toilet Club. The code itself took about 45 minutes. So, in an hour, I created almost 10000 unique "art" pieces. Sounds like work worth millions, isn't it?

# Why
I saw this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je5jSl3Fixc so I decided to make my own from scratch. But as I rarely use python this code is what it is. It is a good practice while shitting on NFTs.

# Now what?
I don't want you to make real NFT with this, but feel free to try it, modify it. It is a lazy code to get the hang of Python again, as I haven't touched it for a long time.

You have to install Pillow (PIL) to use it, but you can see the imports. If you know python you know what you are doing. Also, I commented the code to show how lazy it is. I am self aware like that.
